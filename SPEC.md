# Rising — Product Specification

## 1. Concept & Vision

Rising is an AI-powered savings goal tracker that helps people save for major life goals — starting with homeownership. It feels like a personal financial coach wrapped in a calm, premium app: not anxious spreadsheets, but intentional progress. The experience is grounded in optimism — every deposit is a step forward, every milestone worth celebrating. The name "Rising" captures both financial growth and personal aspiration.

**Who it's for:** People saving for a house, investment property, or big purchase who want to understand their money, track progress visually, and get smart insights along the way.

## 2. Design Language

### Aesthetic Direction
**"Calm affluence"** — the visual language of a premium fintech app that takes money seriously without being cold or clinical. Think: a wealth management app designed by someone who also designs meditation apps. Generous whitespace, purposeful color, confident typography.

### Motion Philosophy
Motion communicates progress and calm. Animations are purposeful — they confirm actions, guide attention, and create continuity. Never decorative.
- Screen transitions: 350ms, easeInOut
- Card appear: 200ms, spring(0.7)
- Button press: 100ms, easeOut
- Sheet present: 400ms, spring(0.8)
- Progress ring fill: 800ms, easeOut
- Number count-up: 600ms, easeOut
- Delete/sweep: 250ms, easeIn

### Visual Assets
- Icons: SF Symbols exclusively
- Illustrations: Programmatic SwiftUI shapes for empty states
- App Icon: Programmatic — upward-trending arrow integrated with rising sun motif
- No stock photos

## 3. Architecture

### Pattern: MVVM + Services
```
Views (SwiftUI)
    ↓ binds to
ViewModels (@Observable)
    ↓ calls
Services (business logic, persistence)
    ↓ uses
Models (data structures, SQLite)
```

### Services
- `DatabaseService` — SQLite.swift persistence layer
- `GoalService` — goal CRUD operations
- `DepositService` — deposit tracking
- `AnalyticsService` — savings calculations, projections
- `OnboardingService` — first-run state management

---
